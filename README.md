# Core Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch:
Building core machine learning algorithms from the ground up using only fundamental scientific computing libraries such as NumPy â€” no high-level frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, or scikit-learn. This project is focused on deepening theoretical understanding and building intuition by implementing each algorithm from scratch and deriving key equations and update rules manually.

### Algorithms Implemented / In Progress:
- Linear Regression (using Stochastic Gradient Descent)
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- K-Means Clustering

### Implementations Of Practical Use Cases:
- Recommender Systems
- Anomaly Detection

### Each Implementation Is Paired With:
- Mathematical derivations and loss functions
- Gradient updates (where applicable)
- Visualizations of decision boundaries, convergence curves, and more

### Side Note:
- *This repository will be continually updated with algorithms, theoretical explanations, and annotated visualizations.*
- *Code is being tested for robustness using tools like unittest.*
