# Core Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch:
---
Building core machine learning algorithms from the ground up using only fundamental scientific computing libraries such as NumPy â€” no high-level frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, or scikit-learn. This project is focused on deepening theoretical understanding and building intuition by implementing each algorithm from scratch and deriving key equations and update rules manually.

- Linear Regression using Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost Classifier
- XGBoost Regressor
- K-means
- Decision Trees

**Will keep updating the repository, and include equations and graphs for background theory on the above algorithms.**

- Check if what I wrote here is all technically correct, and that I don't sound like I don't know what I'm talking about and am using wrong terms in wrong places.
