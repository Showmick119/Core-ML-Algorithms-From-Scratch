# Core-ML-Algorithms-From-Scratch
Coding core machine learning algorithms from scratch, using only scientific computing libraries like NumPy. Currently, locally implementing the following algorithms from scratch:
- Linear Regression using Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost Classifier
- XGBoost Regressor
- K-means
- Decision Trees

**Will keep updating the repository, and include equations and graphs for background theory on the above algorithms**
